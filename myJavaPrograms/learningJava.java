// Btw Java is an object-oriented programming language.
// So in java a class has to be made always
// The class name should be the same as the file name
public class learningJava{
    // This is a method (function inside a class).
    // Its name is main and in Java a main function is always required.
    // If theres no main function, java will show an error
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // This outputs the message "Hello World!"
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        // This outputs the message "My name is Abdullah Abdur Rahim"
        System.out.println("My name is Abdullah Abdur Rahim.");
    
    }
}
