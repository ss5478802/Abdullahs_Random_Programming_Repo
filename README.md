# Welcome to Abdullah Random Programming Repo

Hello, world! I'm Abdullah Abdur Rahim. I'm 15 years old and I'm from Bangladesh. When I'm not busy studying for my Cambridge O Level exams, you'll find me immersed in the world of programming.

## About This Repository

As the name suggests, it has random collection of mini-projects done in different languages. Most of the projects are done to learn new concepts, such as Object-Oriented Programming, or to learn a new language such as Kotlin or JavaScript. It's my digital playground.

## Everyone's Invited!

In the spirit of inclusivity, everyone's invited to this coding party! Whether you're a coding wizard or a fellow newbie, feel free to explore, learn, and share your wisdom. If you leave a comment or suggestion, you'll make my day!

## Connect with Me

If you're a fellow traveler on this coding journey, I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions or share resources that will help me learn programming effectively!
